            "answer":"If you know which section the leader belongs to, simply go to our Contacts page, select the section he/she belongs to, and click on their email address to send an email. If you are unsure of which section the leader belongs to, but know the name of the leader, simply send an email using the following format: firstname.lastname@69scouts.org If you are unsure of the leader's name, but can recognize the leader, proceed to the Contacts page, go to the different sections, and hover your mouse over the leader's names. An image will occur below the name which corresponds to the leader. If you are unable to recognize the leader, simply send an email to info@69scouts.org and we will have your questions answered as soon as possible."

            "answer":"Our group is demand-oriented. Due to a lack of interest in these sections within our recruiting area, and the lack of leader resources, we are unable to hold regular meetings for the sections for the time being. However, there are nearby Scout Groups which offer these sections, and we would like to recommend you to them."

            "answer":"Unfortunately, we do put a cap on the number of people we accept into our group. This is because to ensure that quality program is given, we hold true to the policy of having one full time leader to every 5 youths in each section. This is so the youth can get the individual attention they need to learn. If you would like more information, please feel free to email us at: info@69scouts.org"

            "answer":"No, leaders are volunteers. In fact, if you talk to the leaders, many would tell you that they have part time or full time jobs to support being a leader. We are committed to providing an excellent program for everyone to enjoy. If we were paid, the focus of leaders may not be where it should be: on the youth. The perks of being a leader is that we get to participate in all the events we plan, learn a world of new things from other leaders and the youth, and we get to interact with the youth, while working with friends. We as leaders learn much about leadership, teamwork, organization, and a ton of useful skills! If you want to make a difference, and become a leader of our group, feel free to email us at info@69scouts.org."

If we are unable to do so, we will suggest other groups that will meet your need. We believe that anyone who wishes to join the wonderful scouting movement should not be denied, and we will do everything we can do assist you in finding a group well suited for you."
